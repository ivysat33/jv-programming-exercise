1. How do we want to return this data (ie formatting)

2. Do we want to store this data? 
If yes: 
- do we want to overwrite or do we want to maintain data for each call?
- Which fields do we want to keep? 

3. Is this expected to be a standalone project or a plugin?

4. Should this be a single call or a recurring job for certain users?

5. What should logging/ alerts look like? 

6. Do we want the top level event type or more specific? Should the event name be transformed? 

7. Will it always be the top 3 events?
